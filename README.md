# 📟 Multi-Calculator Project

A set of beautifully designed and fully functional **Simple** and **Scientific Calculators** built using **C++** and **Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**. This project demonstrates foundational programming logic as well as modern web-based UI/UX.

### 🧮 Simple Calculator (C++)
- Built using Object-Oriented Programming in C++.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**.
- CLI-based interaction for quick computation.

### 🧾 Simple Calculator (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Clean and responsive design with a **neumorphic** style UI.
- Supports keyboard inputs and basic math operations.
- Lightweight, smooth transitions, and real-time input processing.

### 🧠 Scientific Calculator (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Elegant dark-themed responsive interface.
- Includes scientific operations like:
  - **Trigonometric functions**: sin, cos, tan
  - **Logarithm**
  - **Factorial**
  - **Power and Square Root**
  - **Constants**: π (pi), e
  - **Percentage, Brackets, Keyboard support**
- Input formatting with error handling and real-time display.
